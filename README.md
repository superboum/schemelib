# schemelib

SchemeLib is my own swiss army knife when coding with scheme, it helps code reuse across my projects.
Code is tailored to my needs, so from an external point of view it's probably the worst standard library imaginable (ok, maybe the PHP4 one was worse).

Of course, there is no documentation.
