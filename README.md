# schemelib

SchemeLib is my own swiss knife when coding with scheme, it helps code reuse across my projects.
Code is tailored to my needs, so from an external point of view it's probably the worst imaginable standard library imaginable (just after the one of PHP 4 and less).

Of course, there is no documentation.
